Move Forward,”</em> participants were encouraged to recognize stressors, examine how they respond to pressure, and develop healthier ways of moving through difficult situations. <strong>Mr. Jhony C. Benedicta, MAGC</strong>, Head of the Office of the Guidance Services, led the session and emphasized practical approaches to emotional regulation, resilience, and intentional coping.',
          'The final session, <em>“Engage in Self-Care, Find Inner Peace,”</em> brought the three-part journey together by helping students translate awareness and coping into sustained personal practice. Through a self-care toolkit, participants explored mental, emotional, physical, social, and personal or spiritual dimensions of well-being. The activity challenged students to move beyond knowing that self-care matters toward identifying concrete practices that can help them protect their balance, strengthen resilience, and maintain healthier responses to daily demands.',
          'The program’s impact was reflected in its participant evaluation. Project RELIEF obtained an overall evaluation score of <strong>3.82 out of 4.00</strong>, indicating strong agreement across the assessed areas of the program. The highest recorded rating, <strong>3.911</strong>, was associated with participants’ commitment to continue applying emotional self-care and resilience practices beyond the sessions. The result is particularly significant because it suggests that the program was received not simply as a one-time activity, but as an experience participants intended to carry into their daily lives.',
          'The evaluation also reflected positive perceptions of the learning environment and the relevance of the program to participants’ personal development needs. Together, these results provide an initial measure of how a research-informed student wellness activity can move from awareness toward behavioral intention and practical application. For the RDC and CoCJE, the program demonstrates how research utilization can become more meaningful when findings and identified concerns are translated into interventions that directly respond to students’ lived experiences.',
          '<strong>Project RELIEF</strong> advances <strong>Sustainable Development Goal 3 – Good Health and Well-Being</strong> by promoting mental and emotional wellness, stress management, resilience, and self-care. It also supports <strong>SDG 4 – Quality Education</strong> by reinforcing the principle that meaningful education requires an environment where students are supported not only academically but also emotionally and personally. By helping learners develop coping skills and healthier responses to pressure, the initiative contributes to a learning environment where well-being and educational development are treated as interconnected.',
          'From a <strong>World University Rankings for Innovation (WURI)</strong> perspective, Project RELIEF demonstrates the value of translating knowledge into practice. Its strength lies in the movement from identified student concerns to a structured intervention, active participation, measurable evaluation, and potential for replication. The three-session design, use of expert guidance, experiential activities, and documented participant response provide a model that may be adapted, expanded, and sustained for other student groups and academic units. Its relevance therefore extends beyond innovation as a new activity; it demonstrates innovation through practical application, stakeholder engagement, measurable results, and the potential for institutional scaling.',
          'The initiative also aligns strongly with the RDC’s <strong>INNOVATES Research Agenda 2026–2030</strong>. It advances <strong>VALUE – Health, Safety, and Well-Being</strong> by directly addressing student mental and emotional wellness; <strong>OPERATIONALIZE – Knowledge Utilization, Innovation, and Improvement</strong> by translating research and identified student needs into a concrete intervention; <strong>INSPIRE – Culture, Capability, and Engagement</strong> by strengthening self-awareness, participation, and resilience; <strong>TRANSFORM – Community Engagement and Social Impact</strong> by promoting empathy, peer support, and a culture of care; and <strong>STRENGTHEN – Education and Institutional Performance</strong> by recognizing student well-being as an important condition for meaningful learning and development.',
          'More than the completion of three sessions, Project RELIEF represents a shift from simply discussing student wellness to acting on it. Its strongest outcome is not found only in the activities conducted, but in the possibility that students leave with greater awareness of their emotions, healthier responses to stress, and a stronger commitment to care for themselves and others.',
          'As Project RELIEF ends, its message remains: <em>emotional wellness is not separate from education—it is part of the journey.</em> By turning research into responsive action, MCNP–ISAP continues to build a learning environment where students are encouraged not only to succeed, but also to become more self-aware, resilient, and prepared to move forward with healthier minds and stronger support systems.',
          'Project RELIEF may have completed its three sessions, but its intended impact continues in every student who learns to recognize, release, reset, and rise.'

          'The College of Criminal Justice Education (CoCJE) continued its student well-being initiative through Session 2 of <strong>Project RELIEF: Let It Out, Lift It Up!</strong>, focusing on stress management, cognitive reframing, and the development of healthier coping strategies.',
          'Anchored on the theme <em>“Let Go of Stress, Improve Mindset”</em> and the message <em>“Pause. Reframe. Reset. Move Forward,”</em> the session provided students with a supportive and engaging space to recognize sources of stress, release emotional burdens, and reflect on more constructive ways of responding to everyday challenges.',
          'Through interactive activities, guided reflection, cognitive reframing, and relaxation exercises, participants were encouraged to understand stress as a normal part of life while recognizing that it does not have to determine how they think, feel, or move forward. The session emphasized four practical responses: <strong>pausing</strong> to breathe, <strong>reframing</strong> challenges from a different perspective, <strong>resetting</strong> by letting go of what can be released, and <strong>moving forward</strong> with a renewed mindset.',
          'The activity was enriched by <strong>Jhony C. Benedicta, MAGC</strong>, who served as the resource speaker and shared practical insights on stress, emotional regulation, and mindset improvement. His discussion helped reinforce the importance of self-awareness, healthy coping, and intentional responses to difficult situations.',
          'Beyond stress reduction, the session promoted resilience and emotional self-management by helping students reflect on how mindset can influence their responses to pressure and adversity. It also reinforced the value of creating learning environments where students are supported not only academically but also in their emotional and psychological development.',
          '<strong>Project RELIEF</strong> supports <strong>Sustainable Development Goal 3 – Good Health and Well-Being</strong> by promoting mental and emotional wellness, while also advancing <strong>SDG 4 – Quality Education</strong> through a supportive learning environment that encourages personal growth, reflection, and healthy coping practices.',
          'The activity also aligns with key directions of the RDC’s <strong>INNOVATES Research Agenda 2026–2030</strong>. It supports <strong>VALUE – Health, Safety, and Well-Being</strong> by strengthening students’ capacity to manage stress and protect their emotional wellness; <strong>INSPIRE – Culture, Capability, and Engagement</strong> by encouraging self-awareness, reflection, and active participation in well-being initiatives; <strong>STRENGTHEN – Education and Institutional Performance</strong> by reinforcing a student-centered learning environment that recognizes emotional readiness as an important part of educational success; and <strong>TRANSFORM – Community Engagement and Social Impact</strong> by helping cultivate a more supportive, resilient, and empathetic student community.',
          'As <strong>Project RELIEF</strong> continues, succeeding sessions are expected to build on these foundations by strengthening students’ capacity to manage emotions, seek support when needed, and respond to challenges with greater awareness and resilience.',
          'Through initiatives such as this, ISAP continues to promote a student-centered environment where well-being, learning, and personal development are treated as interconnected parts of a meaningful educational experience.'
